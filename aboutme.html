<p3><br><br><br> I am Richard from Bolton in Lancashire, as well as loving watching movies I enjoy online gaming with my clan mates at the weekend.
We play Battlefield 2042 and GTAV sometimes and we have people from all over the world having fun chatting to each other.
I enjoy different types of music including psybient, trance, techno and goa.
I have had a long interest in computers for over 20 years, I built my very
first PC after doing an ECDL course at Bolton College in early 2000's. Since then I've built many computers for 
friends and family and enjoy tinkering with Windows' many tweaks. I recently did a Cyber Security Course with Code Nation which was pretty intense 
but I enjoyed it, that then led me into this coding course not long after where I am learning a lot! I'm hoping to do the Master 
Cyber course later this year and get a job in that field.
